### Project Title
***Explore Weather Trends***

### Description
This project introduces the ***"Data Analyst Nanodegree"*** by Udacity. In this Project, I analyzed local and global temperature data.
The goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write-up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live (currently, it is Paris) during the years 1750-2013.

### Files used
I used the following files to accomplish the project:
* **README.md** ;
* **global.csv** - database extract for Global average temperatures ;
* **local csv** - database extract for Paris average temperatures ;
* **Project_Submission.pdf** - the project file to submit to the Udacity team for review ;
* **Weather_Trends.xlsx** - the working Excel file with raw data and visualizations.

### Credits
During the preparation and the submission of the project, **no external source** was used during the submission.
Special thanks to the Udacity team for this project and its review!
